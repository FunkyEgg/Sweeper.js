# Sweep.js

Sweep.js is a javascript package desigend to convert js to pure web code.

## How to install
To install sweep.js you need to:

1. Create a project folder.
2. In a terminal in the project folder type `npm init -y`.
3. In the same terminal type `npm i sweep.js`.

## Sweep.js example
```js
const sweep = require('sweep.js');
// Initializes sweep with the paramiter being the webpage title
sweep.init('Hello World');
// Creates a h1 tag that says "Hello World"
sweep.h('1', 'Hello World');
// Finishes the creation of the HTML file
sweep.endHtml();
```

This basic sweep code ends up outputting
```html
<!-- Generated by Sweep.js -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
